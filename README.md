## Node Project Template

Automatically creates a node project with Usabilla recommended settings and files.

Clone this repo and install packages: 
```
npm install
```
Install yarn globally if you don't have it:
```
brew install yarn
```
Run init: 
```
node scripts/node-project-init.js --projectDir <../relative/path/to/project/dir>
```
If you get a node version error, run:
```
nvm use
```
If you don't have nvm, [install it first](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
